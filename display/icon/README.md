# Notes

This folder contains auto generated icons folders exported from ressources.
Each icon folder again has to be prepared and exported. 
This step is done manually with the DGUS ICO generator.
The created create .ico files must be placed in the DWIN_SET folder.
Not only the icon file, but also the icons must be prefixed with IDs.
Icon IDs can overlap with file IDs or other icons of other .ico files.
Use unique IDs within \[0, 128\] for each icon in the .ico file.
Larger IDs will be rendered black (either a bug or not documented).
For being able to fastly replace icons any time do not modify the IDs.
