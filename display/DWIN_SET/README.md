# Notes

* Copy this folder ../DWIN_SET/ to a flash card with MSDOS Fat32.
* Insert the card into the display and turn it on to upload to the device. 
* The prefixed number is mandatory and determines the segment number (ID) where the file is uploaded.
* IDs 13, 14 and 22 must not be changed. The special .bin files are auto generated by the DGUS software.
* t5uid1XXX.cfg defines the hardware configuration. Remove the file if you don't intend to change the current device settings
* The touch sound effect file must be in the front flash space or it won't play (t5l_dgusII.pdf, p13, fig.3.2).
* Icons file: Prefix each icon with an unique ID (0, 128) within this icons file. Larger IDs will be rendered black.
