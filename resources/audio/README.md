# Notes

WAV files must be compressed. Dont use the WAE generator tool (AllTool.exe) found in DGUS_V7.613 
since the *virus scanner claims this is the Trojan TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2*!
Use the covnert.sh script (ffmpeg) to convert your files.
```
./convert.sh <file-wo-extension> # path to file relative to script
```
The converted files can be found in the ./converted/ folder.
