# Notes

This folder contains auto generated icons folders exported from ressources.
Each icon folder again has to be prepared and exported. 
This step is done manually with the DGUS ICO generator.
The created .ico file must be placed in the DWIN_SET folder.

Not only the (icon)files, but also the icons shall be prefixed with IDs.
Icon IDs can overlap with file IDs or other icons of other .ico files.
Use unique IDs within \[0, 128\] for each icon in the .ico file.
Icons with larger IDs will be rendered black (either a bug or not documented).

For being able to fastly replace icons any time do not modify the IDs.
