# Display resources for DGUS Displays for Marlin

The colors for the theme is inspired from Debian.
This project is WIP.
Currently it is used with Creality Ender-5 Plus and Marlin 2.0.x.
The minor Marlin modifications done so far (https://github.com/rubienr/MarlinFirmware/tree/creality-ender-5-plus-personalized),
are not yet in mainstream!
Maybe here you will find more information: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/12096

# Flash Display

If you only want to flash your display copy the DWIN_SET folder to a compact flash.
Insert the cart into the display and turn it on.
This will initiate the download to display.
After the download is finished re-start the display.

# Personalize Display

Follow the instructions of the README in ./display.
