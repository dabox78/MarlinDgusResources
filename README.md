# Display resources for DGUS Displays for Marlin

This project refines the work done by [coldtobi](https://github.com/coldtobi/Marlin_DGUS_Resources). 
The aim is to make the compiled `DWIN_SET` directory highly configurable so that many UI flavours can be generated by executing one single script.

## The main difference: this project vs. coldtobi

| This | Coldtobi |
| ---- | -------- |
| icons are used to depict anything, screen background is an empty image | every screen has dedicated image |
| icons can be dragged any time with the DGUS software           | every screen background must be modified |
| button effects: audio effect (visual not possible with icons) | button effects: visual effect, every screen needs a 2nd slightly modified screen to overlay the button area when pressed |
| auto generated material is placed into DWIN_SET by one single script `build.sh`: icons, screen background, audio, DGUS configuation | no auto generation  |
| auto generation script can be used to create multiple UI flavours of the same project (by configuration file) | - | 

## Note

* This project is heaviliy WIP.
* Currently it is tested only with Creality Ender-5 Plus and Marlin 2.0.x.
* The project relys on minor Marlin [modifications](https://github.com/rubienr/MarlinFirmware/tree/2.0.x-extui-dgus-origin) which are not yet in upstream!
* Maybe here you will find more information: 
  * [\[FR\] Make DGUS_LCD_UI_ORIGIN config. coherent to Configuration*.h #18035](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/18035)
  * [\[FR\] Integrate low cost DWIN Touch panel #12096 ](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/12096)

# Flash Display

1. If you only want to flash your display copy the `./display/DWIN_SET` folder (not the content) to a compact flash.
2. Insert the cart into the display and turn it on.
3. This will initiate the download to display.
4. After the download is finished re-start the display.

Refer also to the [README](./display/DWIN_SET/README.md) in `./display/DWIN_SET`.

# Personalize Display

Follow the instructions of the [README](./display/README.md) in `./display/`.
